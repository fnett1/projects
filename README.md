## About Me:
I am a Marine Corps veteran with over 7 years of active service. I am a Systems Engineer pursuing my bachelors degree in Cyber Security and Information Assurance. I have a passion 
for Information Security and learning new things. I thrive in situations where I need to learn a new skill in order to complete a task given to me. When I love spending time with 
my family when the work day is done. I have a beautiful wife and two healthy growing boys. Everything I do, I do with them in mind to make sure that they have everything they 
could possibly want or need. I enjoy the outdoors, working out, and building things.

## Interests:
I am interested in pursuing a career in Cybersecurity or Systems Engineering. I would like to gain more experience and eventually transition to cloud engineering or cloud 
security. For the last 3 years of my Marine Corps career, I have been learning about cybersecurity and implementing different cybersecurity technologies. I would love to take on 
new challenges and continue to grow as an informatin security professional. I would love to take my skills and contribute to a team of cybersecurity professionals. I am interested 
in taking the knowledge that I have gained in the Marine Corps and applying it to a civilian career. I learn fast and am eager to continue growing personally and professionally.
