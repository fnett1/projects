## About Me:
I'm a Systems Engineer pursuing my bachelors degree in Cyber Security and Information Assurance. I have a passion for Information Security and learning new things. I thrive in situations where I need to learn a new skill in order to complete a task given to me. When I am not at work, I am a family man. I have a beautiful wife and two healthy growing boys. Everhting I do I do for them to make sure that they have everything they could possibly want or need. I enjoy working out, working on cars, and I enjoy the outdoors.
